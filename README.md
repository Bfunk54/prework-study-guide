# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This project was built to help me learn the basics of coding in 3 languages, CSS, HTML, and Javascript. It also helped me to setup my computer to code and get myself setup for success. It allowed me to learn code and do it somewhat on my own, without being to overwhelming.

## Usage

It contains notes about each we learned about in this Prework section where I'll be able to go back at any time during the program and be able to look at those. As well as being able to look in the console and see the javascript running, even being able to look back at the source code and see what we did where and why.
